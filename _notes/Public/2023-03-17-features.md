# Important Stuff
## Build:
```sh
catkin build
```

## Source:
```sh
source ~/.bashrc
```
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

## Create Package:
```sh
catkin_create_pkg <package name> <dependency 1> <dependency 2>
```
(From catkin_ws/src dir)

Go to where package is defined
```sh
roscd
```

## Core:
Ros 1 is based on a single master node to control everything. Without this nothing will work. Normally auto started from a launch file. If its not started we can with
```sh
roscore
```

## Launch:
```sh
roslaunch <package> <launch file>
```
A launch file is a xml file in the launch folder that defines a few things to launch
Example:
```xml
<launch>
  <node pkg="com2009_team17" type="avoidance_server.py" name="move_server" output="screen">
  </node>
  <node pkg="com2009_team17" type="exploration_client.py" name="exploration_client" output="screen">
  </node>
</launch>
```
(task2.launch)

## Run:
```sh
rosrun <package> <exectuable file>
```
Launches a file marked as executable in the src folder of a package
Sub folder invariant (for some reason)
(chmod +x file.py)
Note: shebang is normally needed to tell os what to run this file with
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```

## Nodes:
```sh
rosnode list
```
List all available nodes
Nodes are things running that can pub and sub

## Topics:
A message that is sent between nodes is put into a topic
For example the cmd_vel topic is for sending messages that control the robot's speed
```sh
rostopic info /cmd_vel
```

```sh
rostopic list 
```

```sh
rostopic echo /chatter
```

```sh
rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist[SPACE][TAB]
```
(to autofill)

## Types:
Each message is formatted to a type
Get information from rosmsg info
```sh
rosmsg info geometry_msgs/Twist
```

Custom types are .msg files in the msg folder
## Services:
Request -> Response between specific nodes
One server, many clients
Synchronous: Has to wait for response from server before client can continue

To call (and autofill)
```sh
rosservice call /move_service[SPACE][TAB]
```

Info
```sh
rosservice info /move_service:
```

rosmsg but for service:
```sh
rossrv info tuos_msgs/SetBool
```
Request/response params seperated by a "---"

Custom types are in srv folder (and, again, are .srv files)

Import into python:
```python
from tuos_msgs.srv import Approach, ApproachResponse, ApproachRequest

# Service
self.service = rospy.Service(service_name, Approach, self.srv_callback)

def srv_callback(self, request_from_client):
	return ApproachResponse()

# Client
service = rospy.ServiceProxy(service_name, Approach)

request_to_server = ApproachRequest()

request_to_server.request_signal = True

response_from_server = service(request_to_server)
```
## Actions:
Service but with feedback
Works using the standard pub sub commands with topics lile
```
/camera_sweep_action_server/cancel
/camera_sweep_action_server/feedback
/camera_sweep_action_server/goal
/camera_sweep_action_server/result
/camera_sweep_action_server/status
```
Pub to goal to start
Sub to feedback to get the status

Define action file to set custom message types:
CameraSweep.action (in action folder, predictably)
```
#goal
float32 sweep_angle    # the angular sweep over which to capture images (degrees)
int32 image_count      # the number of images to capture during the sweep
---
#result
string image_path      # The filesystem location of the captured images
---
#feedback
int32 current_image    # the number of images taken
float32 current_angle  # the current angular position of the robot (degrees)
```

Status List
```
PENDING=0
ACTIVE=1
PREEMPTED=2
SUCCEEDED=3
ABORTED=4
REJECTED=5
```

Import  custom actions (this is from file move.action)
```python
from com2009_team17.msg import MoveAction, MoveGoal, MoveFeedback,MoveResult

# Server
self.actionserver = actionlib.SimpleActionServer(self.server_name,
MoveAction, self.action_server_launcher, auto_start=False)

# Client
self.client = actionlib.SimpleActionClient(action_server_name, MoveAction)
self.client.send_goal(self.goal, feedback_cb=self.feedback_callback, done_cb=self.done_callback)
```

## Open CV:
Python image library
Need CvBridge to convert ros raw data to images

Crop image
```python
cropped_img = cv_img[
    crop_z0:crop_z0+crop_height,
    crop_y0:crop_y0+crop_width
    ]
```

View hue/saturation graph
```sh
rosrun tuos_examples image_colours.py step2_cropping.jpg
```

We can create a mask to filter color values

We can find the centre of a detected area
https://theailearner.com/tag/image-moments-opencv-python/
- `M00`: the sum of all non-zero pixels in the image mask (i.e. the size of the colour blob, in pixels)
- `M10`: the sum of all the non-zero pixels in the horizontal (y) axis, weighted by _row_ number
- `M01`: the sum of all the non-zero pixels in the vertical (z) axis, weighted by _column_ number
```python
m = cv2.moments(img_mask)
cy = m['m10']/(m['m00']+1e-5)
cz = m['m01']/(m['m00']+1e-5) 
```

cv2 save image:
```python
full_image_path = base_image_path.joinpath(f"lol.jpg")
cv2.imwrite(str(full_image_path), cropped_img)
```

cv2 display filtered image (with circle):
```python
hsv_img = cv2.cvtColor(cropped_img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)

lower_threshold = (125, 100, 0)

upper_threshold = (200, 255, 255)

img_mask = cv2.inRange(hsv_img, lower_threshold, upper_threshold)

filtered_img = cv2.bitwise_and(cropped_img, cropped_img, mask = img_mask)
cv2.circle(
	filtered_img,
	(int(cy), int(cz)),
	10, (0, 0, 255), 2)
cv2.imshow("hehe", filtered_img)
```
## PID Control:
![[Pasted image 20240315144804.png]]

$$ u(t)=K_{P} e(t) + K_{I}\int e(t)dt + K_{D}\dfrac{d}{dt}e(t)$$
We can just use P or PI lol

Example for line following of filtered image:
```python
kp = -0.03

reference_input = crop_width/2

feedback_signal = cy

error = feedback_signal - reference_input

ang_vel = kp * error
```
(then we can put ang_vel to robot)
